    st.write("In recent years, recurrent neural network models have defined the normative process \
    in producing efficient and reliable results in various challenging problems such as translation, \
    voice recognition and image captioning, thereby making huge strides in learning useful feature representations. \
    With these latest advancements in deep learning, RNNs have garnered fame in computational creativity \
    tasks such as even that of music generation. In this project, simple piano tunes are used for training \
    and generating new music using deep learning.")

    st.write("For generating music, first we have to train model using input music data. for \
    the input data we are passing midi files. The data splits into two  object types: notes and chords. \
    Note objects contain information about the pitch, octave, and offset of the Note. \
    Pitch refers to the frequency of the sound, or how high or low it is and is represented with the letters [A, B, C, D, E, F, G], with A being \
    the highest and G being the lowest. Octave refers to which set of pitches you use on a piano. \
    Offset refers to where the note is located in the piece. And Chord objects are essentially a container for a set of notes that are played at the same time.")
